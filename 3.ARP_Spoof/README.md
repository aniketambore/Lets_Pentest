## Enable Port Forwarding
Our Kali Linux computer is not the router, so if it get requests, it's actually going to stop them from flowing and going to the router. This is a security feature in Linux.
Enable Port Forwarding so that this computer would allow packets to flow through it just like a router.

```shell script
sudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
```
